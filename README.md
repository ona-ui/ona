# 🌟 Ona – Build Faster. Stand Out.

**Ona Labs** is building the future of web development with **production-ready UI sections**, an **AI-native workflow**, and a **developer-first platform**. Whether you’re launching a startup landing page or scaling a SaaS product, Ona helps you move from idea to production in hours, not weeks.

## 🚀 Why Ona?

Most UI libraries give you isolated components – buttons, inputs, dropdowns. Useful, but they don’t solve the real problem: **developers waste days rebuilding the same hero sections, pricing tables, testimonials, and footers** over and over again. AI tools generate code, but it all looks the same and rarely converts.

**Ona changes that.** We provide complete, battle-tested sections that are:

* Designed from real, high-converting startup pages
* Optimized for **React + Tailwind** (and architected to be framework-agnostic)
* Scalable, customizable, and production-ready
* Easy to integrate with an AI-native workflow (Cursor, Copilot, Claude Code, GPT)

With Ona, you stop coding the basics and start shipping products that actually sell.

## ✨ Features

Ona isn’t just a set of pretty components. It’s a **system** designed for speed, scalability, and real-world production needs:

* 🎨 **20+ UI Sections** – Hero, Features, Pricing, Testimonials, CTAs, Footers, and more
* ⚡ **Developer-First Workflow** – Copy, paste, or use the CLI (`npx ona add hero`) to scaffold sections instantly
* 🔮 **AI-Native** – Works seamlessly with AI tools: let AI handle logic, Ona handles design that converts
* 📦 **Asset & Component System** – A robust architecture to manage components, styles, and assets at scale
* 🔌 **Built-In Integrations** – Analytics (Posthog), Payments (Stripe), Auth (Better-Auth) already wired in
* 🔄 **Extensible** – Infrastructure designed to support multiple frameworks (Vue, Svelte, Solid) in the future
* 💎 **Production-Grade Quality** – Performance-optimized, accessibility-checked, Lighthouse-friendly

---

## 🛠 Architecture

Behind the simplicity of copy-pasting a section lies a **complex, scalable system**. Ona is not just snippets; it’s a structured library with strict asset management, naming conventions, and extensibility in mind.

For contributors, this means:

* Clear separation of concerns between **components**, **assets**, and **packages**
* A compiler-friendly architecture for future AI/automation workflows
* Extensible tooling to support multiple frameworks beyond React

If you’re interested in contributing, expect a well-designed system where your work scales far beyond a single component.

---

## 🌍 Vision

The future of development is **AI-assisted**. But AI alone produces generic, copy-pasted designs. Ona exists to fill that gap: **premium, human-curated UI sections that AI can’t generate**. Combine the speed of AI with the quality of Ona, and you unlock a new era of development.

> AI builds your logic. Ona builds your UI. Together, you ship products that stand out.
